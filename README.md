Quick Callback and Promises testings to not forget it :)

# Callbacks
a function passed as an argument to another function. It is executed after the completion of an asynchronous operation.
# Promises
A promise is an object representing the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation. It has three possible states: pending, resolved (fulfilled), or rejected. Promises use .the () and .catch() to handle success and failure.
Think as a ticket (object) when you buy a burger to take it later, the burger actually may or not be retrieved to you because of employees management problems (eventual completion or  failure)
